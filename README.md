# Overview
- This project investigates the net migration trends between South Asian Countries like Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
- Focusing on the period from 1990 to 2023. 
- The analysis utilizes publicly available datasets to understand migration patterns and their implications on both countries.
- The data set downloaded from World Bank API, for the reliability.

# Data Sources
- The data is sourced from the World Bank, ensuring its reliability and accuracy.

# Analysis Workflow
The Jupyter notebook net_migration_project_south_asia.ipynb performs the following steps:

1. Data Loading: 
   - Imports migration data for all countries from world bank.

2. Data Cleaning: 
   - Handles missing values and ensures data consistency.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualizes migration trends over time.
   - Compares net migration rates between the two countries.

4. Statistical Analysis:
   - Conducts hypothesis testing to determine significant differences in migration patterns.

5. Visualization:
   - Generates line plots and bar charts to illustrate findings.
# Key Findings
- Migration Trends: 
  - Both countries experienced fluctuating migration rates, with notable peaks during periods of economic or political change.
- Comparative Analysis: 
  - India's net migration rate has generally been higher than Pakistan's, indicating a greater influx of immigrants.
